# Refactoring

The goal of this Challenge was to PROVIDE a Marketing Agency a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines
 
As a result of the updated codebase, the HORISEON webpage now meets accessibility standards.
 
WHEN one views the source code, THEN they find semantic HTML elements.
 
WHEN one views the structure of the HTML elements, THEN they find the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
 
WHEN one views the image elements, THEN they find accessible alt attributes.
 
WHEN one views the heading attributes, THEN they fall in sequential order.
 
WHEN one views the title element, THEN they find a concise, descriptive title.
 
The site's links all function correctly; CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure; the site's CSS file is properly commented.
