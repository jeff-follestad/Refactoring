# Refactoring
The goal of this Chellenge was to PROVIDE a Marketing Agency a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines

As a result of the updated codebase,

HORISEON now webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN one views the source code
THEN they find semantic HTML elements
WHEN one views the structure of the HTML elements
THEN they find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN one views the image elements
THEN they find accessible alt attributes
WHEN one views the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN one views the title element
THEN they find a concise, descriptive title
